# Bursary Management Database System

## Overview
The database facilitates funding requests from higher learning institutions on behalf of students. It enables the management of funding allocations by the funder and supports the approval or rejection of funding requests. Funding requests are initiated by the heads of departments of the institutions, and the approvals/rejections are handled by selected members of the funder.
